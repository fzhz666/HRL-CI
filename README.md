# HRL-CI

# Overview

This is a navigation task for  mapless moving target navigation with communication interruption. Our HRL-CI method can greatly improve the success rate and navigation efficiency compared with the pH-DRL method in the case of communication interruption. This project will open source our code, not only to provide developers with a navigation task platform, but also to make the code public.
